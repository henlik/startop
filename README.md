## About Startop

Growing a business that has started with as little as 100 $ is a huge challenge and the outcomes is not satisfying taking into consideration bills, transport, rent and other life expenses.

Investing that capital into a much greater business where you own a share is a good idea.

Where do you find that business?

Our solution is simple,

We are creating a platform where startups after undergoing a sequence of steps to ensure that it worth the investment, is made available within the platform.

The intended startup is divided into shares where you can purchase a piece of it.


## Parts

The platform as three major parts:
The investor section, the startup section and the the administration section.

At the startup section, we manage the startup process from pitch request to the platform to publishing 

At the administration section, we manage the fine tuning of startup to make them investment worthy.

The investor section is an e-commerce platform where we purchase shares.

## Work done so far

We have successfully designed the system to the point where a startup can be submitted, processed and published.

## Remaining work

- Admin section => we are planning to consult investment banking in the country so that we design that section in accordance to regulations and actual practices involves into investment.

- Security section => we have to implement a robust security system with roles, permissions and access control to make the system secure 

- Interactivity => we need to add interactivity into the system with notifications, emails, SMS and chat.


## Technology

In order to implement our platform, we've used these technologies:
- Angular Framework with Material design for front-end
- Firebase for the backend 
- PayPal APIs for payment

The platform so far support PWA and offline data persistance

## Challenges

One of the major challenges that we are facing is, the majority of people here in the Democratic Republic of Congo uses mobile payment instead of traditional banking services. But none of the proposed Fintech APIs support them in the Country.

The solution:  Get in touch with mobile payment service providers in the country to implement it within our system.
